  <p>First off, we'll talk about the "anchor" element &lta&gt</p>
  <p>the content of this anchor element will be the text of the link</p>
  <p>But most important is that the anchor element has an <strong>attribute</strong>: href</p>

    <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
    <li>Absolute links, like to <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
    <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>
    <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
    <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,

      <li>Absolute links, like to  <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
        target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
        resource for web developers.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The only difference between a relative link and a Root relative link is that the former starts with the name of file or folder and the latter with a forward slash &ldquo;/&rdquo;</p>
