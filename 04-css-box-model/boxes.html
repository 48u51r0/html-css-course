  <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

  <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
    elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
      do not.</p>
      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>Every HTML element is a box. Boxes come in two flavours:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Block Boxes</li>
        <li>Inline Boxes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Boxes are defined by 4 properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content: </strong>It's our text or media that we place
          in the element. It's the only piece with semantic value, That's why
          it is in the html.</li>
        <li><strong>Padding: </strong>Space between the box content and its border</li>
        <li><strong>Border: </strong>Line between the box's padding and margin</li>
        <li><strong>Margin: </strong>Space between the box and the surrounding boxes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Vertical Margins collapse</h2>
        <p>Two boxes one of top of the other have their vertical margins collapsed. That is to
        say, the distance between both will be the biggest vertical margin. They are not addtive.</p>
        <p>When we want to bypass this working by de fault, we'll need to add an element between them.</p>
        <p>&lt;div&gt; is the solution. For instance. Check the next two Paragraphs bellow:</p>
        <p>This is Paragraph #1</p>
        <div style='padding-top: 1px'></div>
        <p>This is Paragraph #2. We can see separation distance is bigger here than in between previous Paragraphs.
        That's because vertical margins have not collapsed</p>
        <div>Button</div>
